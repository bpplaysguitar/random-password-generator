## Description
This assignment was to use Javascript to create a web application that will generate passwords using random methods, based on user input of character types to be used in the generation of the password. I was able to learn a lot of new ways to use Javascript, including building entire arrays based on front-end user interaction, more in depth "for" loop and "if" statement uses, and I became very familiar with ASCII character codes. I also learned in talking about this with some developer friends, what makes a truly secure password. We went over the math of the possible permutations. In short: the longer the better, more than anything else. It's a gratifying feeling to build a highly functional and truly useful application, test it over and over, and get it work the way you want.
